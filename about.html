    <h1>More Details About My Life</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>To add on more about my life, for high school, I went to a private school in New Jersey called Saint Joseph Regional High School. I played lacrosse there and my last season of lacrosse was canceled due to covid. My brother also played lacrosse in high school. My brother goes to a college right outside of Albany called Siene College. He should be graduating in about a year.</p>
